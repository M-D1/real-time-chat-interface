**About** : The Project is about   
real-time-chat that has the following   
***Features*** :

* Real-Time-Message Interface
* Multiple Chat Rooms Interface
* Message History Interface
* Online/Offline State of Users
* File Sharing Interface
* Responsive Design
* Loading And Error State

## How To Use The App??

When The App Load You will be in The  
Sign-Up Page now of course this is just a frontend so the information will not be held so go to Aleardy Signed In Log In button


 There You will be asked for username and password 

 ***username is*** : user123

 ***password is*** : w123

 Now you will see the interface of the app

 you can see the chats, their history and you can send messages but when you refresh it will be not saved since I didn't add **localStorage** 

 when you want to add an image to the chat I did not know how to add that to the chat so the interface is just there without functionality

 ### Join Rooms AND Create Room 
 
for now start with join room and add the rooms 

**FROM TOP TO BOTTOM** 

and do not add randomyly because it will not work 

>***THIS IS A BUG***  
I did not know how to solve this bug.  
The app should not act that way  

******
After you finish adding the rooms from top to bottom you can Create A room if you want  However when you click the create room button you need to go back to the chats page then you can access the room


>this is a ***BUG*** also that I did not know how to solve
